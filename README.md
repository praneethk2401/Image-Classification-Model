# Image Classification Model

This is a project on image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in Python programming language with Keras and TensorFlow frameworks.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to classify images into different categories based on their content using a CNN model.

## Dataset

The project uses the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

## Methodology

The project includes data preprocessing techniques such as data normalization and data augmentation to improve the performance of the CNN model. The CNN model architecture used for this project consists of convolutional layers, pooling layers, dropout layers, and fully connected layers.

The project uses Keras and TensorFlow frameworks for building and training the CNN model. The project includes hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal values for various parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.

## Dependencies

* Python 3.x
* Keras
* TensorFlow
* NumPy
* Matplotlib

## Results

The project achieves an accuracy of over 80% in classifying images into different categories using the CNN model.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of CNNs in Python programming language using Keras and TensorFlow frameworks for image classification tasks. The project provides a detailed report and code for easy understanding and analysis of the results.
